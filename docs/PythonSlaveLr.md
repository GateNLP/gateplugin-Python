# PythonSlaveLr

The PythonSlaveLr can be used to Allow Python to control GATE and call the GATE API. For this, the full Python gatenlp package must be installed separately (see [Installation](python-install))

Then creating a PythonSlaveLr from within the GATE GUI or a Java
GATE program is one method to provide a GATE process which can be 
controlled from a Python program.

See the [Python gatenlp GateSlave documentation](https://gatenlp.github.io/python-gatenlp/gateslave) which is part of the 
[full Python gatenlp documentation](https://gatenlp.github.io/python-gatenlp/)
